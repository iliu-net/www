For our May vacation we went to Torremolinos.

Ironically, it is in "Costa del Sol", but it pretty much rained the whole time we were there.  Luckily enough, the hotel that we were staying at, 
[Sol Principe](http://www.melia.com/en/hotels/spain/torremolinos/sol-principe/index.html)
had an indoor pool so we can relax there.  Kalay wanted to spend the most of her time there.

We took a day trip to Granada and Alhambra.  Pretty, but I somehow picture it more impressive.  At any rate it was too far and long for a day trip.

Overall, not a runaway success, but it was nice and fun nonetheless.
