title: Child tracking apps
---

If you're a parent, there's a chance you'll want to track your child
when they're not home. There are 
[physical devices for doing this](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/track-kids-stop-worrying-gps-trackers/),
but there are also a bunch of apps that make it really simple.

1. [Life360 Family Locator](https://www.life360.com/)
2. [My Family GPS Tracker](https://bestmyfamily.com/)
3. [ZoeMob Family Locator](https://www.zoemob.com/)
4. [KidControl GPS Tracker](http://kid-control.com/)

Honestly, this is a market where apps often pop in for a while before
dying out and leaving their users hanging. If you want the most stable
option, you want Life360. It's around to stay.

Though I was very impressed by the My Family app, and if you're wary
about paying for Life360, I would suggest trying that one first.
