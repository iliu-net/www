title: What Drill bit to use
---

If you've ever wanted to know which drill bit you need to get a
certain size hole through a given material, why punch tools are
useful, why different bits are shaped the way they are or how fast
and hard to run your drill while it' working this joint has your
answers.

Most of your DIY drilling projects are probably going to require
the simple "twist-bit"--hat' the standard twisted sharp stick you
probably think of when you picture a drill in your mind. For making
small holes into wood, plastic or softer metals getting the right
twist bit is mostly a matter of getting a decent-quality one made of
the right material and not letting it get too hot while you're
drilling.

Other bits are designed to pull themselves through material like an
"auger bit" or "self-feed" that tend to leave cleaner exit holes
in soft stuff and come in handy when you'e making furniture.

This video takes us through a "hierarchy of materials" from soft to
hard. In this context, the "easiest to hardest to drill through."
You probably already understand that "steel always beats plastic and
wood" in that regard, but I like how AvE explains the toughness of
metals via types of cheese.

If brass is brie, aluminum is gouda and steel is cheddar. Tool steel,
apparently, is like parmesan that' been sitting in a freezer for a
week.

For cutting through that "rozen parmesan" AvE has some seriously
badass bits on display, with internal cooling channels that can only
be run by heavy, fixed machines. On the smaller stuff that you'd
put in a hand drill, he recommends a "medium pressure and a medium
pace." If you'e making heat instead of a hole, you're pressing too
hard or spinning too fast.

That said, spinning your drill bit too slowly can actually be worse
than overclocking it because it will be more susceptible to breakage
under the "200 pound gorilla pushing on it" (he means you).

The key takeaways from the video are basically to spin your bit at the
right speed and pick one made from a material that' harder than the
one you'e boring. And make sure your stuff doesn't get too hot.
