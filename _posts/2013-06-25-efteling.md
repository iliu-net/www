Last Saturday we went to the Efteling.

It was fun but <strong>very</strong> crowded.

This picture was taken from the
<a href="http://www.efteling.co.uk/EN/attractions/attractions-Piraa.html">Piraña</a>
ride there.

They have a impressive "Water show" at the end. I didn't understand why they ran the show at 18:00. It was so bright still that you couldn't see any of the lights of the show. Nevertheless the water works and the pyrotechnics were nice.

We didn't go to all the rides we wanted, so probably we might want to go again, arrive Saturday, stay overnight at the Hotel and go again on Sunday for a two day excursion.
