Because the watch is waterproof, the pin screws into the watch case to form a seal. You must first unscrew the pin by turning counter-clockwise until it is released from its threads. Then you can pull it out and adjust the time as you would with any other watch. Once you are done, remember to screw the pin pack in to keep the watch waterproof.
