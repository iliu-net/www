title: 10 habits that will improve your life
---

## 1. Stay away from people who erode your quality of life.

In Hans Christian Andersen's fable The Red Shoes, a young girl longs
for a pair of pretty red shoes. She ultimately tricks the blind woman
who cares for her into buying her a pair. Her love for the red shoes
causes her to give them priority over the more important things in her
life, and, as often happens in fables, karma is not on her side. The
shoes become firmly stuck to her feet and force her to dance non-stop,
to the point where she almost dies from exhaustion and starvation.

We can scoff at the little girl's foolishness, but, in real life, we
often do the same thingâ"we chase after the things that we think will
make us happy and don't realize that we're heading down a dangerous
path.

We have to be very careful in choosing our pursuits, because our
habits make us. Cultivating the habits that follow will send you in
the right direction. They'll help you to lead a more meaningful and
fulfilling life, whereby you cultivate the best within yourself.

## 2. No more phone, tablet, or computer in bed.

This is a big one, which most people don't even realize harms their
sleep and productivity. Short-wavelength blue light plays an important
role in determining your mood, energy level, and sleep quality. In the
morning, sunlight contains high concentrations of this blue light. When
your eyes are exposed to it directly, it halts production of the
sleep-inducing hormone melatonin and makes you feel alert. In the
afternoon, the sun' rays lose their blue light, which allows your
body to produce melatonin and this starts making you sleepy. By the
evening, your brain doesn' expect any blue light exposure and is very
sensitive to it. Most of our favorite evening devices - laptops,
tablets, and mobile phones - emit short-wavelength blue light brightly
and right in your face. This exposure impairs melatonin production and
interferes with your ability to fall asleep, as well as with the
quality of your sleep once you do nod off. As we've all experienced,
poor nights' sleep has disastrous effects. The best thing you can do
is to avoid these devices after dinner (television is OK for most
people, as long as they sit far enough away from the set). 

## 3. Appreciate the here and now.

Gratitude is fundamental to peace and happiness - not wealth, glamour,
adventure, or fast cars, but simple appreciation for what you have.
Just because you can't afford champagne and caviar doesn't mean that
you never enjoy a meal. Hot dogs and beer on the back deck with your
friends taste just as good. So, don't fool yourself into thinking that
you need something that you don' currently have in order to be happy,
because the truth is that if you can' appreciate what you have now,
you won't be able to appreciate the "good life" if you ever get it.

## 4. Realize that things aren't always as you perceive them to be.

This goes along with appreciating the here and now. That person you
envy because they seem to have the perfect life might be dealing with
all kinds of problems behind closed doors. That "perfection" could be
a total mirage. Your employer's decision to move the office might seem
like a huge hassle when you first hear about it, but it could end up
being one of the best things that ever happens to you. You're not
omniscient and you're not a fortune-teller, so be open to the
possibility that life might have some surprises in store, because what
you see is *not* always what you get.

## 5. Get started, even though you might fail.

Most writers spend countless hours brainstorming their characters and
plots, and they even write page after page that they know they'll
never include in the books. They do this because they know that ideas
need time to develop. We tend to freeze up when it's time to get
started because we know that our ideas aren't perfect and that what
we produce might not be any good. But how can you ever produce
something great if you don't get started and give your ideas time to
evolve? Author Jodi Picoult summarized the importance of avoiding
perfectionism perfectly: "You can edit a bad page, but you can't edit
a blank page."

## 6. Get organized.

People joke about new ideas being in short supply, but I think that
the one resource that's really scarce is spare time. Do you know
anybody who has some? Yet we waste so much of it by not being
organized. We touch things two or three times before we do something
with them (like tossing the mail down on the counter then moving it to
the table so we can cook dinner) and once we've put them away, we
spend even more time looking for them. Have a place for all of those
little things you need to take care of when you get a minute, whether
it's your child's permission slip for a field trip or an overdue bill,
and then get to them in a timely manner; otherwise you'll be searching
through a huge stack of stuff for the one thing you need.

## 7. Start a collection of the things that truly resonate with you.

Have you ever come across a quote or a meme that so perfectly summed
up your feelings that you wanted to keep it forever? You know that it's
in one of those coats you wore five winters ago, and you really hope
it's not the one you gave to Goodwill. When you come across something
that resonates with you - whether it's something that expresses who you
are or who you want to be - have a central place to keep those gems.
It doesn't matter whether it's a spiral notebook, a leather binder, or
a folder on Evernote, have a place to collect the things that matter
so that you can revisit them regularly.

## 8. Do something that reminds you who you are.

We all joke about having "me" time, but what is that, really? It's
making time for those activities that we feel most authentically
ourselves doing, when all the masks are off and we can just be.
Whether it's going for a run or dancing around with your 80s favorites
blaring at top volume, make time for those moments. They're incredibly
rejuvenating.

## 9. Say no.

Research conducted at the University of California in Berkeley shows
that the more difficulty that you have saying no, the more likely you
are to experience stress, burnout, and even depression, all of which
erode self-control. Saying no is indeed a major self-control challenge
for many people. "No" is a powerful word that you should not be afraid
to wield. When it's time to say no, emotionally intelligent people
avoid phrases like "I don't think I can" or "I'm not certain."
Saying no to a new commitment honors your existing commitments and
gives you the opportunity to successfully fulfill them. Just remind
yourself that saying no is an act of self-control now that will
increase your future self-control by preventing the negative effects
of over commitment. 

## 10. Stick to realistic goals.

How many people start January by proclaiming, "I'm going to lose 30
pounds by March!"? Big, scary, crazy goals can be incredibly
inspiring" until you fall short, and then, instead of inspiration,
you're left with disappointment and guilt. I'm certainly not
suggesting that you stop setting goals that push and challenge you,
just that you try to stick within the bounds of reality.

## Bringing It All Together

Your character is determined by your attitude and how you spend your
time, and so is happiness. Stop chasing the things that you think
will make you happy, and start realizing that your peace and happiness
are entirely up to you.
